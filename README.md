This project is using Google Cloud Vision API to labellize images.

It uses a VM build on Google Compute to ask the API, the response is then converted into JSON that can be saved.

To enhance the number of detected objects, you can cut the images in identical rectangular parts.
The object detection seems more precise but the system can detect strange things.
